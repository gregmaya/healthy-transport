## Strategic Orientation

**Why segments, not addresses** — the intervention space for planners is the public realm. Scored 20m bus-route segments answer "where should the stop go?", not "who lives near it?". Address point scores are an intermediate calculation only. A coloured street network is immediately legible and actionable to a planner in a way that a scored building layer is not.

**Why a range, not a point** — different demographic groups have genuinely different dose-response curves (working-age adults, elderly, children). The output is a band of optimal stop locations differentiated by population group, not a single optimum. This is more honest and more useful as a planning input. It turns the question from "where is the best stop?" to "where is the zone where the most people benefit the most?"

**Why scrollytelling → interactive tool** — the reader must arrive at the map already understanding what they're looking at. Narrative builds context; the interactive tool rewards it. The tool is positioned as public health infrastructure, not just a transport planning aid — framing transit investment in terms of healthcare cost savings and active travel dose-response opens different funding channels and creates a more compelling policy narrative.

*If work deviates from these three principles, stop and question why before proceeding.*

## Now

Ordered working list. Delete items when done.

### QA / Validation (one-time)

~~1. **Phase B data validation**~~ ✅ DONE — Findings: (a) Population columns exist only in `entrances_demographics` (correct by design); (b) boundary-adjacent scores look improved but see issue below; (c) no null/zero clusters. Critical bug found: `process_buildings.py` was using `mode='a'` without deleting the output file first, causing entrances to be appended on each re-run (43,037 rows / 4× duplication vs. 15,443 expected). Also found: DAR status=9 (deactivated/closed addresses) were not filtered, adding 477 spurious entrance points. Both fixed. Pipeline fully re-run 2026-04-19.

~~2. **Fix Frederiksberg DAR edge effect**~~ ✅ CLOSED — After deduplication and status=9 removal, processed entrances are 15,443 unique points (5,643 Nørrebro core + 9,800 buffer zone). Frederiksberg spatial coverage is a genuine data-density limitation of the raw DAR, not a pipeline artifact. No further supplementation planned; scores are now computed on clean data.

~~3. **Correlation check**~~ ✅ DONE — Pearson r(`score_catchment`, `score_health_combined`) on 85 internal stops = **−0.404**. Well below the 0.8 threshold. The negative value reflects that geometrically accessible corridors (high catchment) are often commercial/transit arteries with lower residential density, while high health-score zones are residential clusters with fewer but more meaningful connections. The two modes are genuinely differentiating.

### Active UI tasks

~~4. **Score mode naming unification**~~ ✅ DONE — Renamed Baseline → Catchment Score and Contextual → Health Score across all buttons, titles, chart axes, info panels, tooltips, and narrative text in index.html, map.js, scatter.js, scroll.js, and config.js. Internal `data-mode` values and JS variable names unchanged.

~~5. **Segment hover/click popup**~~ ✅ DONE — Hover over any scored segment shows a floating popup with the active score, band category, and group breakdown (Working-age / Elderly / Children) in Health Score mode. Popup tracks mouse position. Uses same popup CSS classes as the stop tooltip. Implemented in `_addPopups()` in map.js, attached to all four segment layers.

~~6. **Scroll transition stubs**~~ ✅ DONE — `showCatchmentRing` and `showBenefitCurves` now set NORREBRO_BOUNDS + footprints visible as background state, so when step 4 reveals the scored network there is no jump. Overlays (image panel / fullscreen SVG) still cover the map during these steps.

### MVP completeness block *(ship together)*

~~7. **Green Paths pipeline**~~ ✅ DONE — Four new columns on all 1,699 bus-route segments: `green_pct_catchment` (fraction of decay-weighted reachable network through parks; mean 13.9%, max 61.5%), `green_time_working_age / _elderly / _children` (green_pct × max_walk_minutes per group; mean ~1.4 / 1.1 / 1.0 min). Green fraction per edge computed as proportional intersection of primal edge with park polygon union. One CitySeer `compute_stats` pass (catchment decay). Parks overlay layer also enabled: `data/web/norrebro_parks.geojson` (77 features), wired to `toggle-parks` checkbox in the interactive panel. Segment hover popup now shows green metric in the active mode.

~~8. **Right panel MVP redesign**~~ ✅ DONE — Floating mode toggle (`#mode-toggle-float`) at top-centre of map viewport; collapsible left panel with localStorage persistence; merged People + Green section with real flat-decay population KPIs (`pop_*_reach_*`), stop KPI row (appears on stop click), green annotation per group bar. `NEIGHBOURHOOD_POP` + `DISTRICT_POP` added to `config.js`; `activeNeighbourhood` + `selectedStop` added to `state.js`.

~~9. **Neighbourhood highlighter**~~ ✅ DONE — Neighbourhood selector in chart-panel header drives: MapLibre boundary outline (`neighbourhood-boundary` layer via `setNeighbourhoodBoundary`), scatter dimming (`updateNeighbourhoodFilter`), distribution accent tick, People + Green comparison row and bar ticks. Client-side point-in-polygon (`neighbourhoodForPoint`) assigns stops to neighbourhoods.

## Phases Ahead

Prune as phases complete.

### Phase 3a — Bus pipeline loose ends
- Re-export `norrebro_bus_segments_scored.gpkg` to `data/integrated/` once edge-artifact decision is confirmed
- Extend health scores to low/high population scenarios
- Green Paths pipeline (feeds MVP block point 7 above)

### Phase 3b — Rail *(blocked on data)*
- Find accurate entrance geometries (evaluate Rejseplanen, DSB open data, OSM — GTFS centroids are not entrance-level accurate)
- Once data confirmed: CitySeer scoring, B(d) Baseline + Contextual modes, export `data/web/norrebro_rail_stops_scored.geojson`

### Phase 3c — Cycling *(methodology TBD — placeholder)*

### Phase 3d — Green Spaces tab
- For each 20m segment midpoint: compute network distance to nearest park polygon + nearest playground (`norrebro_greenspaces.gpkg`)
- Score = B(d) × population per segment, Baseline + Contextual modes
- Export `data/web/norrebro_greenspace_access.geojson` for Green Spaces tab narrative

### Phase 5 — Scrollytelling remaining
- Map transitions: `showCatchmentRing`, `showBenefitCurves` (currently stubs)
- Wire scenario rail to low/high score columns once computed
- UX items:
  - Scatter axes static 0–1 with 0.25 increments (currently dynamic/rescaling)
  - Score mode → clean toggle control (replace pill buttons)
  - Info popup z-index fix (popups greyed out behind opacity layer — must sit above it)
  - Floating narrative cards on full-bleed map for steps 4–6 (cards as overlays, map full viewport)
  - Map tooltip redesign: wide table with population labels as column headers, scores as a single row

### Phase 6 — Interactive tool
- Benefit curve parameter sliders (peak distance, decay steepness) — map updates reactively
- Headline walking-minutes metric panel (total daily walking-minutes for current stop configuration)
- Post-MVP: "drop a hypothetical stop" marginal benefit interaction (requires pre-computed lookup grid or backend)

### Phase 7 — Hardening
- Performance optimisation (tile loading, render performance)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility (WCAG AA)
- Final copy editing
- Deploy to GitHub Pages / Netlify; update README with live URL

- **File naming**: `norrebro_[category].gpkg`
- **Data tiers**: `raw/` → `processed/` → `integrated/` → `web/`
- **Routing**: CitySeer for all network setup and routing
- **Score columns**: `score_catchment` · `score_health_working_age` · `score_health_elderly` · `score_health_children` · `score_health_combined`
- **Walking speeds**: working_age 1.40 m/s · elderly 0.90 m/s · children 1.00 m/s
- **Meta files**: CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md — keep in sync on every commit (enforced by pre-commit hook)
